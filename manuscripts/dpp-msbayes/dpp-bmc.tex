% In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. In
% addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the
% importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in
% studies of escape dynamics.
% We will first consider the expected resistant population at $vT_x$ for
% some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)
% %
% \[
%  E \bigl[Z_1(vT_x) \bigr]= E
% \biggl[\mu T_x\int_0^{v\wedge
% 1}Z_0(uT_x)
% \exp \bigl(\lambda_1T_x(v-u) \bigr)\,du \biggr].
% \]
% %
% If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay
% $Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as
% $T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically
% estimate the expected value as
% %
% \begin{eqnarray}\label{eqexpmuts}
% E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr] &=& \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
% \int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du
% \nonumber\\
% &=& \frac{\mu}{r}x^{1-{\lambda_1}/{\lambda_0}v}\log x\int_0^{v\wedge
% 1}x^{-u(1+{\lambda_1}/{r})}\,du
% \nonumber\\
% &=& \frac{\mu}{\lambda_1-\lambda_0}x^{1+{\lambda_1}/{r}v} \biggl(1-\exp \biggl[-(v\wedge1) \biggl(1+
% \frac{\lambda_1}{r}\biggr)\log x \biggr] \biggr).
% \end{eqnarray}
% %
% Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see \cite{koon,khar,zvai,xjon,marg}).
