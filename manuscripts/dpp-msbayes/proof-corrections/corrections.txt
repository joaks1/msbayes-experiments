Below is a list of corrections that are needed. If you have any questions,
please let me know.

1) Address 2:
    Please insert comma between ``Box 351800'' and ``Seattle''.

2) Line 7:
    ``To understand the processes that generate biodiversity, it is ...''
    ``To understand biological diversification, it is ...''

3) Line 20:
    ``... reduces the tendency of the model to incorrectly estimate models ...''
    ``... reduces the tendency to incorrectly estimate models ...''

4) Line 56:
    Please remove indentation. This sentence should not be a new paragraph.

5) Line 201--202:
    ``... collected i ...''
    ``... collected for population pair i ...''

6) Equation 3:
    In the numerator, S* should be (S*). I.e., it should be in parentheses.

7) Equation 3:
    In the denominator, the Greek letter phi should be bold.

8) Page 4, Line t1.4:
    ``n_1,_i'' should be ``n_1,i''. I.e., The ``i'' subscript should be on the same level
    as ``1,''

9) Page 4, Line t1.9:
    The Y in ``k_Y'' should be uppercase.

10) Page 4, Line t1.34:
    ``t_i'' should be ``T_i''. I.e., the t needs to be capitalized.

11) Page 5, Line t1.3:
    The Greek letter lambda should be in parentheses.

12) Line 268:
    the Greek letter mu should not be subscript.

13) Line 309:
    ``... prior can theta_A.''
    ``... prior can be assigned to theta_A.''

14) Line 320:
    ``T_i'' should be ``t_i''. I.e., please make the t lowercase.

15) Line 375:
    Please replace ``;'' with ``.''

16) Line 432:
    ``... between my model ...''
    ``... between this model ...''

17) Line 602:
    ``When calculating the observed data ...''
    ``When calculating the Euclidean distance between the observed data ...''

18) Line 683:
    ``DU{a,(Y)}'' should be ``DU{a(Y)}'' (no comma).

19) Line t4.5:
    ``DU{aY}'' should be ``DU{a(Y)}'' (Y in parentheses).

20) Table 4:
    The horizontal spacing in the second column of the first two Models (first
    two rows) is really nice, but the horizontal spacing for the second column
    of the remaining 4 models is a bit squished. If possible, please add some
    spacing between the expressions in these last four rows so that it looks
    like the first two rows. More specifically:
     
    For column 2 of rows 3 and 4, add more space before
      - ``tau ~'' 
      - ``theta_A~''
      - ``theta_D1 ~''
      - ``theta_D2 ~''
      - ``zeta_D1 ~''
      - ``zeta_D2 ~''

    For column 2 of row 5, add more space before
      - ``tau ~'' 
      - ``theta_A =''
      - ``zeta_D1 =''

    For column 2 of row 6, add more space before
      - ``tau ~'' 
      - ``theta_A~''
      - ``theta_D1 =''
      - ``zeta_D1 =''

21) Line 1159:
    Please remove indentation. This sentence should not be a new paragraph.
