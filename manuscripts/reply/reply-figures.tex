    Histograms of the number of true divergence times excluded from the model
    preferred by the empirically informed model-averaging approach of
    \citet{Hickerson2013} when applied to simulated datasets in which divergence
    times of 22 pairs of populations are drawn from an exponential
    distribution, $\divt{} \sim Exp(2)$.
    The plots represent (A) unadjusted and (B) GLM-adjusted estimates from 1000
    simulation replicates analyzed using $5\e6$ samples from the prior.
    The proportion of simulation replicates in which at least one true
    parameter value is excluded from the preferred model ($p(\divt{} \notin
    \hat{M})$) is also given.

    The tendency of the empirically informed model-averaging approach of
    \citet{Hickerson2013} to (A--D) infer clustered divergences and (E--H)
    support the extreme model of one divergence when applied to simulated
    datasets in which the divergence times of 22 pairs of populations are
    randomly drawn from the uniform distributions $\divt{} \sim U(0,
    \divt{max})$ indicated at the top of each column of plots (divergence-time
    distributions are given in units of millions of generations ago (MGA)
    assuming a per-site rate of 1\e{-8} mutations per generation).
