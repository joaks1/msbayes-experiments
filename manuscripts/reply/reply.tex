\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    Biogeographers frequently seek to explain population and species
    differentiation on geographical phenomena.
    Establishing that a set of population splitting events occurred
    at the same time can be a potentially persuasive argument that a set of taxa
    were affected by the same geographic events.
    Unfortunately, estimating divergence times precisely when one lacks
    precise information about the rate of molecular evolution is a notoriously
    difficult problem in evolutionary biology.
    \citet{Huang2011} introduced an approximate Bayesian approach which can be
    used to estimate the probabilities of models in which multiple sets of taxa
    diverge at the same time. 
    This method (implemented in the software \msb) does not require a common
    set of character data that links all of the taxa under investigation, but
    does require the relative mutation rates among the taxa and loci to be
    assumed \emph{a priori}.
    Recently, \citet{Oaks2012} used this model-choice framework to 
    study 22 pairs of vertebrate lineages which are distributed across
    the Philippines; they also studied the behavior of the \msb approach
    using computer simulations.
    \citet{Oaks2012} found that the model was very sensitive to the prior and
    that the inference method had low power to detect variation in divergences
    times.
    These results were not surprising, in light of a rich statistical literature
    showing that the marginal likelihood of a model is sensitive to the
    use of vague priors.
    Because this sensitivity to prior assumptions affects the crucial insights 
    that a researcher who employs \msb seeks to gain, \citet{Oaks2012} recommended
    that users of the approach should carefully assess the robustness of their 
    conclusions to different priors.
    According to \citet{Hickerson2013}, the lack of robustness in \msb analyses
    was due to excessively broad priors on divergence times, leading to 
    inadequate numbers of simulation replicates.
    They proposed a new model-averaging approach that uses narrow, empirically
    informed uniform priors.
    Here we demonstrate that the approach of \citet{Hickerson2013} is
    dangerous in the sense that the empirically-derived priors often
    exclude from consideration the true values of the models' parameters.
    On a more fundamental level, we question the value of adopting an empirical
    Bayesian stance for this model-choice problem, because it can mislead model
    posterior probabilities, which are inherently measures of belief in the
    models after prior knowledge is updated by the data.
    The robust Bayesian approach of conducting analyses under a variety
    of priors can reveal prior sensitivity and communicate which assumptions
    underlie model inference.
    Furthermore, simulations provide insight into the temporal resolution of
    the method, which in turn helps guide interpretation of results.
