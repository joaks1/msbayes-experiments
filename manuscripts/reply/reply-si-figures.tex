%% Validation results
\siFigure{../../model-choice/results/validation/results/pymsbayes-results/plots/mc_behavior.pdf}{
    An assessment of the approximate Bayesian model-averageing approach of
    \citet{Hickerson2013} under the ideal conditions when the prior model
    is correct (i.e., the datasets are simulated from parameters drawn from the
    same prior distributions used in the analysis).
    The plots show the relationship between the estimated posterior and true
    probability of (A \& C) $\numt{}=1$ and (B \& D) $\vmratio{} < 0.01$, based
    on 50,000 simulations.
    The results summarize the (A \& B) unadjusted and (C \& D) GLM-adjusted
    posterior estimate from each simulation replicate.
    The prior settings for all replicates included five prior models with
    $\meanDescendantTheta{} \sim U(0.0001, 0.1)$ and $\ancestralTheta{} \sim
    U(0.0001, 0.05)$ for all five models, and
    $M_1: \divt{} \sim U(0, 0.1)$,
    $M_2: \divt{} \sim U(0, 1)$,
    $M_3: \divt{} \sim U(0, 5)$,
    $M_4: \divt{} \sim U(0, 10)$, and
    $M_5: \divt{} \sim U(0, 20)$.
    The number of samples from the prior was $2.5\e6$.
    The simulated data structure was 8 population pairs, with a single 1000
    bp locus sampled from 10 individuals from each population.  The 50,000
    estimates of the posterior probability of one divergence event were
    assigned to 20 bins of width 0.05.
    The estimated posterior probability of each bin is plotted against the
    proportion of replicates in that bin with a true value consistent with
    one divergence event (i.e., $\numt{}=1$ or $\vmratio{} < 0.01)$.
