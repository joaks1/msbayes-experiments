    The joint posterior of the mean (\meant{}{}) and dispersion index ($\vmratio{} = 
    \vart{}{}/\meant{}{}$) of divergence times for 22 vertebrate taxon pairs as
    estimated by \citet{Hickerson2013} (see Figure 2B of \citet{Hickerson2013}).
    The posterior samples are color-coded to indicate the erroneous mixture of
    timescales in the analysis of \citet{Hickerson2013};
    grey = $0.05/\mutationRate$ generations and
    black = $0.02/\mutationRate$ generations.
