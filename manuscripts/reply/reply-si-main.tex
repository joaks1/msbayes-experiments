\section*{An error in Hickerson et al.'s re-analysis of the Philippines data}
\citet{Hickerson2013} re-analyzed the dataset of \citet{Oaks2012} using a
model-averaging approach, where they placed a discrete uniform prior over eight
different prior models (see Table 1 of \citet{Hickerson2013}).
However, there is a fundamental error in the methodology of
\citet{Hickerson2013}: their model mixes different time units.

Each of the eight prior models used in the re-analysis by \citet{Hickerson2013}
has one of two priors on the mean size of the descendant populations of each
taxon pair:
$\meanDescendantTheta{} \sim U(0.0001, 0.1)$ or
$\meanDescendantTheta{} \sim U(0.0005, 0.04)$.
As described in \citet{Oaks2012}, the divergence time parameters of the model
implemented in \msb are scaled relative to a constant reference population
size, \myTheta{C}.
This reference population size is defined in terms of the upper limit of the
uniform prior on the mean size of the descendant populations,
\meanDescendantTheta{}, such that for the prior $\meanDescendantTheta{} \sim
U(\uniformMin{\meanDescendantTheta{}},\uniformMax{\meanDescendantTheta{}})$,
$\myTheta{C} = \uniformMax{\meanDescendantTheta{}}/2$.
Thus, the model used by \citet{Hickerson2013} mixes two different units of
time.
In other words, some of their prior and posterior samples are in units of
$0.05/\mutationRate$ generations, whereas others are in units of
$0.02/\mutationRate$ generations.

The fact that their posterior samples are in different units makes the results
of \citet{Hickerson2013} difficult to interpret, and renders their
regression-adjusted results invalid.
A fundamental assumption of regression is that all of the values of the
response variable are in the same units.
Thus, the results in sections ``Using ABC Model Comparison to Weight
Alternative Priors for the Philippine Vertebrate Data'' and ``Improved Sampling
Efficiency by Prior Weighting Supports Asynchronous and Recent Divergence for
the Philippines Vertebrate Data'' and presented in Figure 2 of
\citet{Hickerson2013} should be disregarded.
The error is easily illustrated by re-plotting their results with the different
time units indicated (Figure~\ref{figJointPosteriorHickerson}).

Following \citet{Oaks2012}, we characterize the model-choice behavior of the
model-averaging approach of \citet{Hickerson2013} under the ideal conditions
where the prior is correct (i.e., the data are generated from parameters drawn
from the same prior distributions used in the analysis).
We used the same prior models as above ($M_1$--$M_5$;
Table~\ref{tabModelChoiceEmpirical}), and generated 50,000 pseudo-replicate
datasets under this prior (10,000 from each model).
We used a simulated data structure of eight population pairs, with a single
1000 base-pair locus sampled from 10 individuals from each population.
We then analyzed each of these replicate datasets using the same prior,
retaining 1000 posterior samples.
Our results are very similar to \citet{Oaks2012}, but we note that they
are not directly comparable as our simulations contained eight population
pairs rather than 10 (Figure~\ref{figValidationMCBehavior}).
We find that the approach of \citet{Hickerson2013} estimates the posterior
probability of divergence models reasonably well when all assumptions of the
method are met (i.e., the prior is correct) and the unadjusted posterior
estimates are used.
Similar to \cite{Oaks2012}, we find that the regression-adjusted estimates of
the model probabilities are biased.
