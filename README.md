Overview
========

This repository serves as an [open-science
notebook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science) for research
conducted by [Jamie Oaks](http://www.phyletica.com), Charles Linkem, Jeet
Sukumaran, and others into Bayesian methods of phylogeographcial model choice.
We use simulated and biological data to assess the behavior of existing and
newly developed methods for estimating the probability of models of shared
divergence times across a set of co-distributed populations.

Requirements
============

Replicating our work will require a unix shell and Python. Specifically, we
conducted the work using bash and Python version 2.7.

Also, most of the heavy lifting was performed using the Python package
[`PyMsBayes`](http://www.github.com/joaks1/PyMsBayes), which should work in Linux
and Mac OsX.

If you want to go so far as to generate the plots used in the manuscripts and
slides, you will also need the Python plotting library
[`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/).
If you want to compile PDFs of manuscripts and slides, you will also need
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).
