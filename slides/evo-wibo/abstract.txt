Title:
An Improved Nonparametric Approximate-Bayesian Method for Estimating Shared
Evolutionary History

Abstract:
To understand the processes that generate biodiversity, it is important to
account for large-scale processes that affect the evolutionary history of
groups of co-distributed populations of organisms.
Such events predict temporally clustered divergences times, a pattern that can
be estimated using genetic data from co-distributed species.
I introduce a nonparametric approximate-Bayesian method, dpp-msbayes, for
estimating shared divergence histories across taxa using DNA sequence data.
Using analyses of biological and simulated data, I compared the performance of
the new approach to the method implemented in msBayes.
The new method has improved robustness, accuracy, and power for estimating
shared evolutionary history across taxa.
Compared to msBayes, the new approach better estimates posterior uncertainty,
which greatly reduces the chances of incorrectly estimating biogeographically
interesting scenarios of shared divergence events.
This new tool will allow evolutionary biologists to better leverage comparative
genetic data to assess the affects of regional and global biogeographical
processes on biodiversity.
